Create a HTML sitemap and preview directly inside the editor! No more complicated shortcodes. Boost the SEO performance of your WordPress site.

== Description ==

The most popular HTML sitemap available for WordPress just got even simpler to use. You can now build and preview your sitemap visually directly in the post editor!

There's no need to use confusing and complicated shortcodes anymore. Constant swapping back and forth between the editor and front end is a thing of the past.

Simple Sitemap helps improve your SEO ranking by automatically generating an HTML sitemap of your content. Add a full sitemap literally in seconds. No coding or setup required. Works straight out of the box and includes plenty of flexible customization options.

The latest version now also includes a responsive tabbed layout option that looks fantastic. We're super excited to share this with you.

= KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER =

Simple Sitemap is a well-established plugin and has been consistently developed and maintained for several years. It's currently used on over 80,000 websites.

The big news is that we've recently completely overhauled the plugin and added some great new features. Two dedicated editor blocks have been added that allow you to add and edit your sitemap directly inside the new WordPress editor codenamed <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg</a>. You no longer need to leave the editor to preview your sitemap like you do when using shortcodes.

There are also new plugin settings available to determine how parent page links are managed.

= INTRODUCING THE NEW SITEMAP EDITOR BLOCKS =

The two new sitemap blocks have been added to replace the following shortcodes:

* <code>[simple-sitemap]</code>
* <code>[simple-sitemap-group]</code>

This means you don't have to remember a long list of obscure shortcode attributes or go hunting in the documentation to see what features are available.

Simply add a sitemap block to the editor and configure the sitemap settings in the block inspector panel to the right. Everything is managed visually and is very intuitive. If you thought the plugin was easy to use before just wait until you try out the new sitemap blocks!

Be prepared to be blown away at just how quick and easy it is to add a sitemap and configure settings.

= SHORTCODES ARE STILL AVAILABLE =

Alternatively, if you're using an older version of WordPress, or you have the Classic Editor plugin installed, then you can still use shortcodes to display a sitemap. Just add the <code>[simple-sitemap]</code> or <code>[simple-sitemap-group]</code> to any page and the sitemap will be visible when the page is viewed on the front end of your site.

However, wherever possible we recommend you switch to using the new sitemap blocks instead as they are just so much easier to use than shortcodes.

= WHAT'S THIS? TABBED LAYOUT YOU SAY? =

That's right. We've added support for a fully tabbed layout in Simple Sitemap. While a lot of users are happy with displaying a sitemap in one long list you can now optionally display each post type in a separate tab too.

The ordering of sitemap tabs can be controlled via the block inspector panel along with all the other sitemap settings.

The tabs have been implemented via pure CSS and no JavaScript code is needed to render them. This means there's less to go wrong and the tabs load quicker - they just have a nice snappy rock-solid feel to them.

As a bonus, the tabs are 100% responsive so on mobile devices you can be sure your sitemap still looks great!

= FEATURES GALORE =

Here's a breakdown of the features included with Simple Sitemap.

* Build sitemap visually. No Shortcodes needed!
* Preview sitemap directly in the editor.
* Choose from standard or tabbed layouts.
* Beautiful 100% CSS sitemap tabs. (no JavaScript)
* Display any number of posts or pages.
* List sitemap items in ascending or descending order.
* Sort by field. (e.g. title, author, date, ID)
* Optionally display post excerpt.
* Toggle post type label.
* Display individual sitemap items as text or links.
* Sitemap shortcodes available as an alternative to blocks.
* Plugin settings to manage parent page links.
* Intelligent script handling.
* Support for multiple sitemaps per page.

Scripts used by the plugin will only be added to posts or pages that contain a sitemap block. They will NOT be added globally to all pages which would be inefficient.

Also, each sitemap has a unique ID assigned to it which is used to namespace the CSS. This enables you to add multiple sitemaps to a page and apply different settings/styles to each one.

= ADVANCED SITEMAP FEATURES =

<a href="https://wpgoplugins.com/plugins/simple-sitemap-pro/" target="_blank">Simple Sitemap Pro</a> has been designed for sitemaps that need more features and advanced configuration options.
 
It contains more blocks, more shortcodes, and plenty of user interface controls for fine-grained control over exactly what's included in the sitemap and how it's rendered. This added flexibility allows you to generate almost any type of sitemap you can think of!

In particular the following <a href="https://wpgoplugins.com/plugins/simple-sitemap-pro/" target="_blank">additonal features</a> are available.

* Add any custom post types to a sitemap.
* List posts sorted by any custom taxonomies.
* Tabbed layout is fully responsive.
* Advanced tabbed layout options.
