## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites
Install and configure WP Engine Local: https://wpengine.com/support/local/. 

## Github Integration
This repo is not tied to WP Engine deployments nor WP Engine Local. It is merely a means to manage code changes.

Feature branches are leveraged to manage all local development and isolate change(s) that can be merged into the Master branch via Pull Requests, which is the pathway to deployment.

## Deployment
Merge the feature branch via an approved Pull Request into Master and resolve conflicts. Once complete, WP Engine Local is used to push projects to the various configured environments.
